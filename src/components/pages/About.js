        <p>
          Completed a 6 month Full Stack coding bootcamp with the University of Sydney and Trilogy Education Services.

          I have used HTML, CSS JavaScript to produce websites and web apps.

          I have been able to apply concepts learnt through the bootcamp to build a fully functional MERN application.

          Through the bootcamp I have learn the skill to be able to research new concepts and apply them to any web application.

          Which has stimulated my thirst to continually apply my new skills within the industry.
